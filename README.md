# Python GUI Development with Tkinter
In this repo you are going to be able to find some activities I did based on the knowledge acquired during the "Python GUI Development with Tkinter" course of Lynda.com. This activities are not the ones displayed in the course, they are excercises that I designed for myself based on the information of each chapter in the course.
